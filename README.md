Dynamic Resume Builder Project
Overview
This project is a dynamic resume builder application created using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to create, edit, and share professional resumes with a smooth and visually appealing interface. Throughout the development, I have carefully crafted each milestone to meet all required functionalities while significantly enhancing the user experience.

Milestones Breakdown
1. Static Resume Builder
The initial version of the project, where I structured the resume using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. This version showcases a basic resume layout with static content.

2. Published and Deployed
I published the project on Vercel for deployment, ensuring that the project is accessible online and the code is well-structured in a single GitHub repository.

3. Dynamic Resume Builder
This version introduced form functionality. Users can now dynamically input their information, and the resume updates in real-time.

4. Editable Resume
The resume is fully editable, allowing users to make changes directly on the form and see the updates reflected immediately.

5. Unique Path and Shareable Link
The final milestone introduced unique URLs for each resume, based on the user's input (such as a username). This feature allows the resume to be shared through a unique link, and the resume can also be downloaded as a PDF, maintaining all the design and formatting.

Improvements and Enhancements
I made several significant improvements to the project during this development phase:

Enhanced UI Design: The user interface is now much more polished and professional. I carefully integrated Tailwind CSS to create a responsive and visually appealing layout that elevates the overall user experience.
Consistency and Functionality: The resume builder now maintains its design and structure throughout all milestones. This ensures that users have a seamless experience, from creating a resume to downloading and sharing it.
Responsive Design: The project is fully responsive, providing an optimal experience across all devices, including mobile and desktop.
PDF Download with Styling: The PDF download feature ensures that all styles, images, headings, and background colors are preserved.
